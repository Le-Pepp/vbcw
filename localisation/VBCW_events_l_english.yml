 vbcw.politics.1.d:0 "A Crisis has befallen the British Isles, such as has not been seen for centuries, and the Country, indeed the Empire, stands at the brink of bloody ruin.\n\nIt all began in the final weeks of 1936, when Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, citing widespread opposition from Parliament, the public, and the Church of England, informed King Edward VIII that neither he nor his Cabinet could condone the King's marriage to American socialite and divorcee Wallis Simpson. Effectively presenting the King with an ultimatum, Baldwin threated to resign his position unless the King renounced either his affection for Mrs Simpson, or the Crown.\n\nKing Edward, calling the Prime Minister's bluff, summoned Baldwin to the Palace and told him in no uncertain terms he would abandon neither the woman he loved, nor his birthright. True to his word, the Prime Minister immediately offered his resignation, and was swiftly followed by the rest of his Cabinet. Attempts to come to an agreement with the remaining MPs came to nothing, effectively leaving the country without a Government.\n\nFinally, the King turned to his personal friend Oswald Mosley, invited him to the Palace, and exercised his Sovereign Authority to appoint Mosley the new Prime Minister."

 vbcw.politics.2.t:0 "A Very British Civil War"
 vbcw.politics.2.d:0 "The appointment of Mosley, already notorious for his extreme views, and not currently a Member of Parliament, caused widespread outrage across both Houses of Parliament. A staged walkout of MPs and Peers alike saw Parliament reduced to little more than rump assembly of Monarchists, Mosleyites and the few idealists who believed they could still influence events by democratic means.\n\nMosley's appointment proved equally unpopular with the population at large, sparking protests across the country. Clashes between right-wing and socialist organisations, already commonplace in many urban areas, escalated into widespread violence over Christmas and the New Year, and many police forces struggled to keep the peace.\n\nViolence continued into the spring, amidst calls for the army to be called in to keep order. Unwilling to deploy troops against his own people, the King instead authorised the raising of Auxiliary Constabularies. Formed largely of pro-Mosley thugs, the Auxiliaries began to take a very heavy-handed approach and soon came to be seen not as keepers of the peace, but as enforcers of the King's personal rule, which only served to further galvanise his opponents.\n\nDespite this, it was announced that his Coronation in May would go ahead as planned."

 vbcw.politics.3.t:0 "A Very British Civil War"
 vbcw.politics.3.d:0 "On the day of the Coronation, large crowds gathered around Westminster Abbey and along the King's route from Buckingham Palace. Security was very tight, with the King travelling in a closed car rather than the tradtional open carriage, and the route being lined both with soldiers of the Guards Regiments and with members of the Metropolitan Auxiliary Constabulary.\n\nHowever, as the Royal Procession entered Parliament Square, three shots rang out, narrowly missing the King's car, which immediately sped off along Whitehall toward the relative safety of Downing Street. Almost immediately, the Auxiliaries opened fire into the assembled crowd, believing the would-be assassin to be among them. In response, the Guards began firing on the Auxiliaries, with the ensuing exchange of fire lasting for fifteen minutes before senior officers managed to restrain their men.\n\nVisibly shaken as he took refuge at Number Ten, Edward called on Mosley to immediately impose martial law on the capital, granting him a free hand to increase the powers of the Auxiliaries. The King then returned to the Palace under heavy escort, and fled London that night to take up residence with Mrs Simpson at a Worcestershire country estate, where they were soon quietly married.\n\nThe following weeks saw widespread accusations and recriminations over the attempt on the King's life, culminating in the disbanding of the Guards regiments. The soldiers, once considered loyal servants of the Crown, were sent home, deeply resentful of having their honour so besmirched."
 vbcw.politics.3.a:0 "Good Lord, and then what?"
 vbcw.politics.3.b:0 "That's quite enough. To arms!"
 
 vbcw.politics.4.t:0 "A Very British Civil War"
 vbcw.politics.4.d:0 "As spring turned into summer, unrest continued to grow. The imposition of martial law further increased the resolve of the King's opponents, and many left-wing and anti-monarchist groups across Britain began to organise themselves into armed militias. Realising that even the Auxiliaries couldn't hope to maintain order in such a climate, the King finally agreed to deploy the Army, on the proviso that regiments would only serve in their home counties.\n\nAcross the Empire, meanwhile, the crisis had far-reaching consequences. The governments of Australia and New Zealand both fell as they struggled to maintain order, and the already fiercely nationalistic government of South Africa seized the opportunity to declare independence. In India, the Viceroy was only able to maintain order by force of arms, and British territories across the Middle East were beset by sporadic uprisings. Closer to home, Irish Taoiseach Eamon de Valera sent troops into Northern Ireland, ostensibly to help restore order, but ultimately to reclaim Ulster for the republic.\n\nOnly Canada remained unscathed, and offered refuge to the King's brothers and their families as they fled the increasingly hostile situation at home."

 vbcw.politics.5.t:0 "A Very British Civil War"
 vbcw.politics.5.d:0 "Summer soon gave way to autumn, but the tension at home and abroad showed no signs of abating. The leaders of the Anglican Church, driven by Archbishop Cosmo Lang's vehement opposition to the King's marriage, declared Edward unfit to serve neither as head of the Church of England, nor indeed as King. The newly formed Anglican League quickly became a focal point for public opposition to the King, attracting thousands of members within its first few weeks. Inspired by this example, the Scottish Kirk followed suit and convened a Council of State. Declaring that Scotland would no longer recognise the rule of Edward or of the London government, the Council effectively established the Scottish Republic, and closed the border with England.\n\nIn Wales, a similar wave of nationalist fervour bubbled to the surface, particularly in the rural north, where an independence movement was quickly established, raising its banner in the ancient capital of Machynlleth. Meanwhile, the industrial areas of south Wales, reflecting a pattern seen across the whole of Great Britain, saw the rapid growth of Workers' Militias, nucleating around local Trade Unions.\n\nThe United Kingdom was rapidly becoming anything but."

 vbcw.politics.6.d:0 "Winter began to draw in, but the shorter days and colder nights did nothing to cool the passion simmering under the surface in every village, every town, and every city. As the various bands and militias began to crystallise into organised factions, Britain became an increasingly volatile powder keg."
