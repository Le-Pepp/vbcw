And was it not the Roundheads and parlimentarians under Cromwell that overthrew our king, cut off his head and caused a civil war? Now is the time for action, in order to reclaim our throne.

JAC_unify_scotland:0 "Unify Scotland"
JAC_unify_scotland_desc:0 "With all the land that constitutes as Scotland under our juristiction, the process of rebuilding and unification can begin.
