###EVENTS###
#KER_events.1.t:0 "The Cornish Propose a Trade Deal"
#KER_events.1.d:0 "A few days ago, a Cornish delegation with a very thick accent arrived in the city of Cork. After a very confusing dialogue in which both sides attempted to understand each other, it was finally decided that these strange men must be here as some sort of delegation. They were taken to the local mayor who finally managed to get to the bottom of the situation - these men are a trade delegation for Kernow. They were invited to speak with our own ministers, and over a nice cup of tea decided that - "
#KER_events.1.a:0 "The Cornish are nice chaps - yes, let us agree"
#KER_events.1.b:0 "If we can Hardly understand them, how on Earth are we meant to trade?"
#KER_events.2.t:0 "The Irish agree to the Deal"
#KER_events.2.d:0 "Our delegation returned to Truro today. They told us of their voyage across the sea, their near-death encounter with a Royalist motorboat armed with a four-pounder cannon and how they finally reached Cork. After a large deal of inconvenience, they were finally given the time to talk to the Irish economic ministers. During a meeting that quickly devolved into small talk, it was decided that our two countries will, in fact, tighten trade relations. The immediate transportation of their coal and aluminium will commence and in return we will invest in some of their local industries."
#KER_events.2.a:0 "How nice of them"
#KER_events.3.t:0 "The Irish refused our Deal"
#KER_events.3.d:0 "Our Delegation came back with a truly terrifying tale to tell! After a dangerous crossing to Cork, where their ship was boarded by a Royalist motorboat armed with a four-Pounder cannon, they had reached Cork. After a very rude conversation with the locals which included phrases such as 'these bloody Cornish' and 'God's sake speak English' the delegation was finally arranged to meet the Irish minister. After a very long and again, rude, conversation however, the negotiations broke down after one the Irish ministers said that 'We can't even understand you, how are we meant to trade?'. Our delegates may have been speaking unclearly yet that was no reason for the Irish to be so rude! We don't need their Stinking coal anyways...."
#KER_events.3.a:0 "Bloody Irish, can't even give us some coal"
