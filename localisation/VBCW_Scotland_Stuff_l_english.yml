SCO_events.1.t:0 "The Death of Alexander MacEwan"
SCO_events.1.d:0 "Our beloved leader, Alexander MacEwan, has passed away. At the age of 65, it seems he had numerous health complications he had hid for a lengthy amount of time in order to govern the SNP and Scotland. This also raises more questions, over succession. \n The most likely candidate is John McCormick. However, he favours Scotland becoming a dominion of England rather than full independence. \n Another very strong candidate is Andrew Dewar Gibb, who favours the status quo and continuing MacEwan’s legacy. \n A young outsider is Robert Mcintyre, a more left wing choice that favours more radical change and rapprochement with the People’s Armies. \n Who wins the vote?
